In this repository, I create Python notebooks to do the following two things:
1. Demonstrate the connection to Microsoft SQL Server (2017 version) using the Python ODBC interface and the Pyodbc module.
2. Conduct data pre-processing on the famous sample SQL database, Northwind. The SQL programming skills I covered would be in order from introductory to advanced level.
