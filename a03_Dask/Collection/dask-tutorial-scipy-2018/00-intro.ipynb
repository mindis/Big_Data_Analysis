    "Dask can scale down to your laptop laptop and up to a cluster. Accordingly, the tutorial comes in two pieces. In the first part, we'll use the environment you setup on your laptop to analyze medium sized datasets in parallel on your laptop.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second half, you'll log into a [Pangeo](https://pangeo-data.github.io/) [Jupyterhub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) deployment that will provide you with your own Dask cluster to solve even larger problems using a cluster of machines."
